Weather Application built using Async and Await functions.
OpenWeather's API suite was used to fetch Weather Data of various cities.

A searchbox is present to input a city's name. When entered, weather details will be fetched and shown dynamically on the page.
An alert will be sent if an incorrect city is entered or if nothing is input.
Keyboard operations for Enter have been enabled.

Kindly update your API key in the js file before attempting to fetch.
